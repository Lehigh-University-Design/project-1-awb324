        <h1>The History of Merit Networking</h1>
        <div class="post"> 
            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1966 as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad, Merit Network, Inc. received initial funding from the State of Michigan. Its primary objective was to furnish computer networking services to educational and research institutions within the state. Merit initiated one of the earliest computer networks, linking the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University. </p>

            <p>The three Universities had created their first new logo which would represent the Michigan Educational Research Information Traid Inc. (MERIT):</p>

            <h2>Expanding</h2>
            <h3><span class="highlight">1970:</span></h3>
            <p>A company called Reliance Electric in Saline, Michigan was hired to build three Communication Computers (CCs) for Merit. Each CC was like a special computer that could connect directly to mainframe computers. Merit staff wrote programs for these CCs, while university staff wrote programs for the mainframe computers. The first connection, completed in December 1971, linked mainframe computers at Wayne State University (WSU) and the University of Michigan (U-M). Later, in October 1972, Michigan State University (MSU) joined the network. The whole network was officially started on May 15, 1973.</p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">1974:</span></h3>
            <p>Herzog returned to teaching at the University of Michigan's Industrial Engineering Department, and Aupperle became the director. The name "MERIT" was changed to "Merit" in lowercase. The network initially allowed host-to-host interactive connections, expanding to include terminal-to-host connections, batch connections, and interactive file copy. Merit connected with Telenet (later SprintNet) in 1976, offering dial-in access across the United States. By 1978, Western Michigan University joined Merit, prompting a name change. Merit developed new hardware interfaces called Primary Communications Processors (PCP) and Secondary Communication Processors (SCP) in 1983, enhancing software to support TCP/IP and interconnecting with the ARPANET.</p>
            <h3><span class="highlight">1987:</span></h3>
            <p>Merit, IBM, and MCI won a project to create a new super-fast network called NSFNET for the National Science Foundation. It started in 1988 and connected supercomputing centers across the US much faster than before. This network helped scientists and educators at universities all over the US connect with each other and with people worldwide. This project made Merit grow a lot. They almost tripled their staff and set up a new center that operated all day and night to manage the network.</p>
